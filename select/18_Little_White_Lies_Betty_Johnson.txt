The moon was all aglow
And Heaven was in your eyes
The night that you told me
Those little white lies

The stars all seemed to know
That you didn't mean all those sighs
The night that you told me
Those little white lies

I try but there's no forgetting
When evening appears
I sigh but there's no regretting
In spite of my tears

The devil was in your heart
But Heaven was in your eyes
The night that you told me
Those little white lies

Who wouldn't believe those lips
Who wouldn't believe those eyes
The night that you told me

Those little white
Those little white
Those little white lies
