Why do you go on playing your game?
You're toying with my heart
You say you're gonna be true to me
So when are you gonna start?
I don't wanna hear no stories
I don't wanna hear no lies
Just save them for someone else
Your silly alibis

Oh, you better stop
Don't wanna hear it
Don't wanna know it
Don't care to see your crying eyes
'Cause I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it
No little white lies
Don't tell 'em to me
Your little white lies

Why do you go on playing your games?
You're toying with my heart
You say you're gonna be true to me

Oh, you better stop
Don't wanna hear it
Don't wanna know it
Don't care to see your crying eyes
I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it
No little white lies

Do you think I'm such a fool to believe all the things you say?
(Do you think I'm a fool?)
I've been around for long enough just to know what's at stake

Well, do you think I'm some kind of
Fool to believe the things you say?
(Do you think I'm a fool?)
I've been around for long enough just to know what's at stake
I don't wanna hear your stories
I don't wanna hear your lies
Please save them for someone else
Your silly alibis

Oh, you better stop
Don't wanna hear it
Don't wanna know it
Don't care to see your crying eyes
'Cause I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it
No little white lies
Don't tell 'em to me
Your little white lies
Your little white lies
Your little white lies
Ow!
